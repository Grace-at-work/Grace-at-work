- 👋 Hi, I’m @Grace-at-work
- 👀 I’m interested in the Bible, classical piano music, football, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to start a life anew in a totally new environment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on videos, web publishing, You Tube contents that need Korean-English or English-Korean subtitles. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... via e-mail is best.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... I don't know who else I need to be or want to be but a 'she'.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... Get to know me. I don't usually spread rumors about myself until I get to know you personally. haha
